            <ul>
                <li>Test the design rules for your printer(s) (group project)</li>
                <li>Design and 3D print an object (small, few cm) that could not be made subtractively</li>
                <li>3D scan an object (and optionally print it)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Learning outcomes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify the advantages and limitations of 3D printing and scanning technology</li>
                <li>Apply design methods and production processes to show your understanding.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Have you:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Described what you learned by testing the 3D printers</li>
                <li>Shown how you designed and made your object and explained why it could not be made subtractively</li>
                <li>Scanned an object</li>
                <li>Outlined problems and how you fixed them</li>
                <li>Included your design files and ‘hero shot’ photos of the scan and the final object</li>

                <a id="settings">Slic3r Settings</a>
                <li>3D printers are far from being plug 'n play devices. There is a lot of adjusting and some of it looks like magic. I will highlight the most important points to pay attention in the settings of the software<b>Slic3r</b>, that works in conjunction with <b>Repetier</b>.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Still on <b>Repetier</b> in the "Slicer" tab the software presents us with several options of preset configuration. The first is the slicer software itself. On the drop-down menu it is possible to chose from <b>Slic3r</b>, <b>Cura</b> or the older software nobody uses...</li>
                    <li>On Print settings we will have characteristics of the particular model you want to print, my current choice is "coarsewithsupport" later on I will discuss how I chose the settings that make up the presets presented;</li>
                    <li>Then we have "Printer Settings", normally the settings related to a specific printer (machine) goes here, in my presets I have here the different printers of the lab being one a cartesian printer "Mini_2.5_retraction" and another not shown that is a delta printer;</li>
                    <li>Here on "Filament Settings" are the many filaments one can have each with its different setting like color, temperature or thickness;</li>
                    <li>On this item we will dive deeper on the settings. We will actually setup the presets displayed before.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="pic"> <img src="media/3d_scanning_and_printing/slic3r01.jpg">
                </p>
                <ol>This <b>Slic3r</b> is the slicer software itself that is buried deep in the <b>Repetier</b>. Its realms are not for the faint of heart, where wrong moves here, or should I say settings, might render catastrophic results in your prints.
                    <li>So as <b>Slic3r</b> presents in the first column we have the classes: Print settings, Filament and Printer;</li>
                    <li>Then we have in the second column drop down menus to chose each preset that the user wishes to customize</li>
                    <li>The third column we see an icon in shape of a gear, a typical icon that is for configuration, lets click on it to open each class and see it's entrains.</li>

                <ol>Now we are in the Print Settings tab:
                    <li>Lets see sub-class by sub-class starting with Layers and Perimeters.</li>
                    <li>In this area we can see Layer hight this is a important setting that should not go beyond the nozzle diameter size. If you are in a hurry and don't care about the appearances go hight. I have chosen 0.3 mm for a thought feeling. The layers will be noticeable and slopes will look like stairs. If you need a detailed result go low, the limits of how this can go low are near infinite but because time is limited I suggest not going lower than 0.1 mm, lower number means more layers, and it will be smooth as peach skin. </li>
                    <li>Now after each tweak click on this strange blue square shape that reminds me of past times before all this excess of information and the echo-chambers, before this true limitless universe of terabytes around us. Its called a floppy-drive. If you don't click believe me you will regret as nothing will be saved, but fear not, <b>Slic3r</b> won't let you do that without a warning.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Now this sub-class of the Print settings is infill. One can save a lot of time and money here. Someone once said they are both the same, frankly I rather own the first than the second: The infill I have is 20% I am not a cheap bastard, I believe 20% is enough after all the ephemeral pieces this printer expels rarely are worth to use all this corn, ah did I mention I am using PLA a derivate of corn, of course not thats later in filaments... So for now believe me 20% is enough for almost all prints. If you need to tow a truck go crazy use 100% if in the other hand you want to make a delicate vase 0% will leave you a hollow print.

                <p>On this subsection of Print settings, the famous Skirt and Brim, the savvy fabber can use Brim instead of the ridiculous and wasteful rafts done by those who won't take time to level and calibrate their printers. Well by using a wide brim you make sure your print won't detach from the bed. Brim basically are lines next to each other and attached to the print, its great for a spiky model's base, or just corners that want to take off from the print bed "warping". The skirt is used to kind of clean ones noose I mean nozzle yes the printer nozzle, the part that the filament gets out from. This setting will extrude a line around the model to be printed specially useful when filament promiscuity is the case so when changing colors or filament types be sure to either extrude in the air or add some skirt before your print.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The subclass of Support material I leave for the people who won't challenge their machines for the ones who don't care to calibrate and level.</p>
                <p>Starting with Support material you use this for overhangs. Support builds under your model in the places where the negative slope is to steep in other to prevent real birds nest by free forming under your nose I mean nozzle.</p>
                <p>Raft, how I hate rafts I don't want to even talk about haft, I wonder how much popcorn has been erased from the universe by the usage of raft! Well like the name implies none want to be on, or use a raft. Its for emergencies and should be kept only for that. It creates a waste of material that will compensate poorly the lack of leveling, its for the lazy but in the end promotes more work as the under side of the print will not ever be as smooth as the printed part that was printed directly on glass. Support also does that. Try printing with support and then spend the next hours post processing your prints, super fun stuff.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The class of filament settings deserves not much time as they are straight forward, if your filament supplier cares about you, he will give you the temperature in which to print in a label in the sides of the box or spool. The diameter is and has always been with me 1.75mm, the thinner diameter is easier to push than 3mm the other standard in filament thickness after all we are pushing filament thru a nozzle with 0.4 mm in diameter thats thin so choosing a printer that takes a thin filament is better!</p>

                <p>Here in printer settings we find nozzle size, I use 0.4 mm, and my preferred setting on this tests, well practically the only one I messed with i the "retraction". As being the engineer and technician of my printers its little what I haven't tried before. The retraction yes the retraction will depend on many factors, too much retraction and the filament can get stuck in the nozzle guaranteeing one a lot of fun disassembling a nozzle that the filament froze in higher levels is terrible to fix. Too litle retraction and will will have spider web all around your towers. So This is a setting that needs to be tested and tested until like many others by trial and error mastered to what resembles perfection, if that even exists in FDM of course.</p>

                <li> Next I took the Gcode I had save on the SD card and placed on the 3D printers and started the print.

                <li> The prints were not bad but there was a lot of oozing (spider web). So I increased the retraction by .5 mm and then by 1 mm the improvements were very noticeable in both printers.

                <li> I decided to create a necessary part of my final project. It's a wire organiser that when connected together works as a chain.

                <p>This design is either to hard or even impossible to do with subtractive technic due to its shape and details inaccessible to a 2 axis CNC or even to a 3 axis.</p>

                <li>On the tab "Slicer"
                    <ol>
                        <li>I started by selecting the choice of slicer software, I chose the software called "Slic3r" with a 3 instead of the letter "E", and yes this is a confusing name.</li>
                        <li>Next I selected the pre-configured setting coarse with support.</li>
                        <li>Then the best option according to the previous tests, Mini 2.5 retraction</li>
                        <li>On Extruder there are only one pre-configured in this printer so no choices available.</li>
                        <li>Advanced configuration are available on the option "configuration" but in my case it was not needed as the already tested pre-configuration should work fine.</li>
                        <li>Finally click on "Slice with<b>Slic3r</b>" in order to start the slicing process.</li>
                    </ol>

                </li>
                <li>Now the model is ready to be printed. This can be done by clicking on the button "Print". The top arrow I point to the statistics of the print, it would take 1:41 minutes to print the scanned model which chose not to do. In the lower arrow its possible to see the support material that was prepared for the print.
